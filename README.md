# Presentation of my work

This is a project for recruters and other developers to see my project working structure as well as file managment.
Since it is a Web project, it slightly differs from Mobile app projects that I mainly do. 
<br/>
Im using [Atomic design pattern](https://medium.com/@janelle.wg/atomic-design-pattern-how-to-structure-your-react-application-2bb4d9ca5f97)
<br /> 
<br />
Feel free to check out my code and even steal some of if ;)
